# Versioning Policy

This repository uses semantic versioning for protocol releases:
- MAJOR: breaking protocol contract changes
- MINOR: backward-compatible additions
- PATCH: fixes and clarifications

## Compatibility

Consumer repositories should pin a tag release and upgrade intentionally.

## Minimum release checklist

- protocol docs updated
- registry/schema compatibility reviewed
- creator scripts validated
- migration note included if behavior changes
