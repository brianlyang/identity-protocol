# Identity Protocol v1.0 (Draft)

## Core model

Identity = control plane.

- Canon: hard governance and conflict priority.
- Prompt: role cognition and operating principles.
- Runtime JSON: state machine and execution contract.

## Dual track

### A) Hard guardrail track

- Non-bypass constraints.
- Compliance and safety boundaries.
- Mandatory escalation conditions.

### B) Adaptive growth track

- Failure pattern extraction.
- Strategy updates and replay tests.
- Skill and prompt tuning queue.

## Runtime minimum contract

`CURRENT_TASK.json` must include:
- objective
- state_machine
- gates
- source_of_truth
- escalation_policy
- required_artifacts
- post_execution_mandatory

## Conflict resolution

1. Canon/hard guardrail
2. Runtime state contract
3. Skill instruction
4. MCP/tool preference
