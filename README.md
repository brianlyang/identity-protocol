# identity-protocol

Protocol-grade identity control plane for autonomous coding agents.

This repository standardizes identity as a first-class layer parallel to:
- **skills** (capability packaging)
- **MCP** (tool transport/execution)

Identity defines:
- governance boundaries (hard guardrails)
- runtime state contract (single source of truth)
- adaptive learning loop (failure -> update -> replay)

## Structure

- `identity/catalog/` — identity metadata registry and schema
- `identity/protocol/` — protocol and runtime integration specs
- `skills/identity-creator/` — creator skill to scaffold/validate identity packs

## Design principles

1. Align with official Codex skills model and discovery behavior.
2. Keep compatibility with native Codex config (`skills`, `mcp_servers`, `model_instructions_file`).
3. Keep identity concise, deterministic, and auditable.
4. Keep conflict resolution explicit: `canon > runtime > skill > tool preference`.

## Status

- Protocol version: `v1.0` (draft)
- Creator skill: `identity-creator` (bootstrap)
